# night_owl_bookie

This is a collaboration for our projects and algorithms stack. Developers involved are Patrick Fisher, Maria Alter, Claude Will, and Molorerdene Erdene.

Site visitors can take a peek of a "books of the month" page as well as comment on their experience with the book. They can also be add books into the "suggestions for next month" and make a comment on why they are adding the book to the suggestions. They can add/delete comments in both and also add/delete books in the "suggestions" page.
